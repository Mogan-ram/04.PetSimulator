# Virtual Pet Simulator

## Project Overview
This is a web-based Virtual Pet Simulator developed as part of the Unified Mentor Internship Program. The application allows users to care for a virtual pet by feeding, playing, and putting it to sleep, with attributes (hunger, happiness, energy) displayed via progress bars. The petâ€™s state is reflected through emoji changes and CSS animations, built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structures the pet display, progress bars, and interaction buttons.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides responsive styling via CDN.
- **CSS**: Custom animations for pet states (happy, hungry, sleeping).
- **JavaScript**: Manages pet attributes, real-time updates, and user interactions.

### Features
- **Interactive Pet**: Users can feed, play, or put the pet to sleep, affecting hunger, happiness, and energy.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Attributes decay every 5 seconds when awake, with progress bars reflecting changes.
- **Visual Animations**: The petâ€™s emoji changes (e.g., ðŸ˜´ for sleeping, ðŸ˜£ for hungry) with animations (bouncing, shaking, sleeping).
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to desktop and mobile screens using Tailwind CSS.
- **Status Messages**: Displays the petâ€™s state (e.g., "Your pet is happy!").
- **Sleep Mode**: Disables interactions while the pet sleeps, restoring energy.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd virtual-pet-simulator
   ```
3. **Open the Application**:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
   - No additional dependencies are required, as Tailwind CSS is loaded via CDN.

### How to Use
1. **Interact with the Pet**:
   - **Feed**: Click "Feed" to increase hunger (+20) and happiness (+10), but decrease energy (-5).
   - **Play**: Click "Play" to increase happiness (+20), but decrease hunger (-10) and energy (-15).
   - **Sleep**: Click "Sleep" to toggle sleep mode, restoring energy (+5 every 5 seconds) but decreasing hunger (-1). Interactions are disabled during sleep.
2. **Monitor Attributes**:
   - Progress bars show hunger, happiness, and energy levels (0-100).
   - Attributes decay every 5 seconds when the pet is awake (hunger -2, happiness -1, energy -1).
3. **Pet Status**:
   - The petâ€™s emoji and animations change based on its state (e.g., hungry if hunger < 30, happy if happiness > 70, sleeping).
   - Status messages update in real-time (e.g., "Your pet is hungry!").

### Project Structure
```
virtual-pet-simulator/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html      # Main HTML file for the pet simulator
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css       # Custom CSS for pet animations
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js       # JavaScript for game logic and attribute updates
â””â”€â”€ README.md       # Project documentation
```

### Code Quality
- **Modular**: Separate functions for updating bars, pet status, and handling interactions.
- **Safe**: Prevents interactions during sleep and ensures attribute bounds (0-100).
- **Testable**: Attribute update logic is isolated for potential unit testing.
- **Maintainable**: Clear variable names, comments, and organized code.
- **Portable**: Runs in any modern browser with only Tailwind CSS CDN dependency.
